This  presents the design and implementation of a scalable services program developed using Node.js and Express. The primary objective is to create a robust backend solution capable of handling multiple service requests efficiently, supporting real-time operations, and ensuring high availability. The program leverages the non-blocking, event-driven architecture of Node.js, coupled with the minimal and flexible Express framework, to deliver a performance-oriented and maintainable codebase.
